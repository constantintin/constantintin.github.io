      <h1>Recommendations</h1>

      <h2>Waking Up - Sam Harris</h2>
      <p>This meditation app markets itself with: "A new operating system for your mind."</p>
      <p>It is time to realize how free you already are in this moment.

      <h2>Vim Bindings</h2>
      <p>Learning Vim can feel like going into the rabbit hole. But while daunting at first it starts
        to become intuitive very fast. Soon you will be flying through text, editing at the speed of light.
      Pretty much any text editor or IDE has Vim integration so you can continue to use your favorite tool.</p>
      <p>The biggest benefit is not the speed, though it is a nice side effect. Coding is just that much more fun using Vim. Get started learning: <a href="https://www.openvim.com/">OpenVim</a></p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.assimil.com">Assimil</a></h2>
      <p>Assimil is a great choice if you want to *get* the basics of a new language by self-study.
        Less boring study by heart, more learning by osmosis.</p>

      <h2>Dune - Frank Herbert</h2>
      <p>What every sci-fi novel aspires to be.</p>
      <p>These books are still expanding my mind, even after the 7th reread.
        Herbert introduces countless interesting concepts and possibilities of the future
        while writing an exciting and character driven story.</p>

      <h2>Siddhartha - Hermann Hesse</h2>
      <p>For all seekers.</p>
      <p>The definitive Hesse novel. An adventure of mind and meaning that will leave
        you deeply changed. This is a must read if you are at all interested in
        eastern philosophy. And if you are not, you will be after reading.</p>

      <h2>Millenium Actress - Satoshi Kon</h2>
      <p>Mind bending character piece.</p>
      <p>Kon uses animation to create so many layers of narrative only your subconscious
        will be able to follow.</p>

      <h2>Infinite Jest - David Foster Wallace</h2>
      <p>Monumental deconstruction of American culture</p>
      <p>Wallace's extraordinarily creative use of language and one of a kind humor
        will keep you engaged as you puzzle together the nested plot about addiction,
        competitive tennis and lethal entertainment.</p>

      <h2>Foucault's Pendulum - Umberto Eco</h2>
      <p>What 'The DaVinci Code' wants to be.</p>
      <p>If you are at all interested in conspiracy theories or the occult,
        this book is for you. Eco achieves incredible historical detail without
        sacrificing characters or actual plot.</p>

      <h2>Joseph und seine Brüder - Thomas Mann</h2>
      <p>Grandios. Mystisch. Veraenderte meine Perspektive auf das Leben und die Zeit.</p>

      <h2>Das Parfüm - Patrick Süskind</h2>
      <p>Eine fesselnde Reise in den unterschätztesten Sinn und das Herz eines grausamen Genies.</p>
